This repository contains the source code for the Master Thesis of Janic Tom Weber.


## Requirements

To compile this thesis, one needs a TeX Live 2022 distribution. All figures in the thesis are compiled using scripts that are contained in this repository. This means, having installed the `adpatfx` package, one can recreate all plots. The `adpatfx` package installs dependency automatically needed for plotting. Python version 3.10 or later is necessary. Ideally one has also created a virtual environment. So in summary:

1. TeX Live 2022
2. Python 3.10 or Later
3. `adaptfx` package


## Reproduce

If you want to reproduce the thesis, i.e. recompile it and recreate all the figures, do the following (ideally inside a virtual environment, like `venv`):

First, clone and enter the repository, then install the dependencies from [adaptfx](https://github.com/openAFT/adaptfx)

With the `adaptsim` CLI run
```
$ ast -f graphics/*.json
```

And after this, you can build the entire document by running
```
$ latexmk -bibtex -f -logfilewarnings -nobibfudge -outdir=./_build -pdf ada.tex
```
